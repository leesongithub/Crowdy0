# Crowdy - A website to find movie theaters' crowdedness!
Welcome to Crowdy! This is a small website built by Leeson Chen, Bridget Homer, Alexander Barnard, Jack Schulte, and Xing Huang at the University of Florida. The point of this website is to show to users how crowded their local movie theaters are, by implementing a map API, database, and additional features requested by the client.  

## How to run 
Clone this repository your usual way, then simply run: 

```script
$node server.js
```

Then visit [**localhost:8080**](localhost:8080) in your browser (we recommend Firefox and Chrome), and enjoy exploring our site! 

## Features
The core features of this website are the map API (from MapBox) with colored indicators for each theater, that gets data fed into the database by users. Additional features we implemented include login for theater owners and users, a voting system, and other methods of displaying information.


## Roles and Contributions
Leeson Chen: user interface design, markers, map information, view pages for login, list, map, and info, splash page & graphics
